## 🧠 Project Summary

This project investigates **gender bias**, **perceived difficulty**, and **tag-driven stereotypes** in student evaluations of professors. Using a large dataset scraped from RateMyProfessor.com, we applied Bayesian adjustments, statistical hypothesis testing, and visualizations to uncover patterns in how students rate and describe faculty.

## 📌 Key Questions & Findings

| **Question** | **Summary of Findings** |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Q1:** Is there pro-male bias in professor ratings? | Yes, male professors received slightly higher ratings (mean diff = 0.03, p < 0.005). Bias persists across subsets. |
| **Q2:** Is rating variance different between genders? | No. Variances were similar. Levene’s test not significant (p = 0.0082 > 0.005). |
| **Q3:** What’s the size of the bias? | Small but statistically significant. Cliff’s delta = 0.0386 (negligible effect). |
| **Q4:** Are certain tags gendered? | Yes. 18/20 tags showed significant gender differences. “Hilarious” and “Amazing Lectures” for males; “Participation Matters” for females. |
| **Q5:** Is there gender bias in difficulty ratings? | Slight bias found. Male professors perceived as less difficult. Difference was statistically significant but small. |
| **Q6:** Is there a difference in perceived quality between online and offline classes? | Yes. Offline classes received significantly higher ratings than online ones (mean diff ≈ 0.26). Ratings were adjusted using Bayesian smoothing. |
| **Q7:** Are “pepper” professors rated more favorably, and does this vary by gender? | Yes. “Pepper” professors had higher average ratings. This effect was stronger for male professors. Gender interacted with “pepper” status in perceived quality. |
| **Q8:** Do highly rated professors tend to be viewed as easier or harder? | Higher-rated professors tended to be rated as easier. Negative correlation between average quality and difficulty. Bias toward favoring “easier” professors. |
| **Q9:** Is there a difference in ratings by field (major)? | Yes. Professors in Humanities and Arts fields generally received higher ratings. Quantitative fields (e.g., Math, Engineering) saw lower average ratings. |
| **Q10:** Are there university-level differences in professor ratings? | Yes. Significant variation across universities. Some universities consistently had higher or lower-rated professors. Regional patterns were also observed. |
